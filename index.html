      <p>
        Python is an interpreted, high-level and general purporse programming language.
        Its easy syntax,  dynamic typing and versitility make it not only a powerful 
        scripting language but also one that provides a more gentle introduction to
        coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python's versitility allows it to be used in various fields such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Server-side development with popular web frameworks such as django and
          flask. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Data Science and Statistics wih libraries such as matplotlib, numpy,
          pandas and tensorflow.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="Requirements">

        <h1>Python 3 and Python 2</h1>
      </header>
        <p>
          Python 2 made code development process easier than earlier versions. It implemented technical details of Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP). 
          Python 2.7 (last version in 2.x ) is no longer under development and in 2020 has been discontinued.
        </p>
        <p>
          On December 2008, Python released version 3.0. This version was mainly released to fix problems which exist in Python 2. 
          The nature of these change is such that Python 3 was incompatible with Python 2. It is backward incompatible Some features of 
          Python 3 have been backported to Python 2.x versions to make the migration process easy in Python 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Python 2.7 has been discontinued as of July<sup>3rd</sup> 2020 and you should 
          therefore use Python 3.9</strong>
        </p>  
    </section>
    <section id="Hello World">
      <header>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
      To get started with writing Python, open your text editior and write the following code:
      </p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <code>
          print("Hellow World")
        </code>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now save your file as 'Hello_World.py' and enter <i>'python Hello_World.py'</i> into the
        command line.  
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Variables">
      <header>
        <h1>Variables</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. It means that when you create a variable, 
        you reserve some space in the memory.
      </p>
      <p>  
        Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. 
        Therefore, by assigning different data types to the variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Declaring Variables">
      <header>
        <h1>Declaring Variables</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. 
        The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. 
        The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.
        The operand to the left of the '=' operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the '=' operator is the value stored in the variable.
      </p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <code>
          number = 10   #Assigns an integer 10 to number<br>
          name =  "John" #Assigns a string 'John' to name
        </code>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="Constants">
      <header>
        <h1>Constants</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed. 
        It is helpful to think of constants as containers that hold information which cannot be changed later.
      </p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <code>PI = 3.14    #Assigns 3.14 to constant PI</code>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="Data Types">
      <header>
        <h1>Data Types</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. 
        It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. 
        Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following are the standard data types of Python:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Numbers</li>
        <li>String</li>
        <li>List</li>
        <li>Tuple</li>
        <li>Dictionary</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="If else Statements">
      <header>
        <h1>If else statements</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition  is true (See the logical conditions reference the full list). 
        Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
      </p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <code>
          money = 5.00
          price = 3.00 <br><br>
          if price > money: <br>
          <span>print("The price is too expensive")</span><br>
          else: <br>
          <span>print("The price is cheap")</span><br>
        </code>
      </div>
      <p>
        The above block of code shows a program which will print a statement depending of the vaule of the variable 'price'.
        If the value of price satisfies the first condition then it's print statement will be executed and the program will end. 
        However if this condition is not satisfied then the 'else' code block will be executed instead. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also add adtional conditions to make our code account for different scenarios using the 'elif' statement. For
        example we can add a condition which checks to see if the variable 'money' and 'price' have the same value.
      </p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <code>
          money = 5.00 <br>
          price = 3.00 <br><br>
          if price > money: <br>
          <span>print("The price is too expensive")</span><br>
          elif price == money: <br>
          <span>print("The price is just right")</span><br>
          else: <br>
          <span>print("The price is cheap")</span>
        </code>
      </div>
      <p>
        The code above is just a modification of the previous example. However this example has added an additional condition
        which will account for the variables being equal and therefore making the program more robust. 
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="While Loops">
      <header>
        <h1>While Loops</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.
        If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. 
        If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
      </p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <code>
          i = 0 <br><br>
          whiile i < 6: <br>
          <span>print(i)</span><br>
          i = i + 1  
        </code>
      </div>
      <p>
        The code above assigns the value 0 to the variable 'i' then creates a while loop which will print it's value and increment it
        as long as 'i' is less than 6. When 'i' finally becomes 6 then the program will exit the while loop. <br><br>
        <strong>Note the while loop will run endlessly if the condition is never met in this case if 'i' never increments above 6.</strong>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Functions">
      <header>
        <h1>Functions</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action when called. 
        Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.
      </p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <code>
          def square(x):<br>
          """"Returns the square of a given variable"""<br>
          <span>return x*x</span><br>
        </code>
      </div>
      <p>
        The above block of code shows the basic layout of a python function. It first defines the function with 'def' followed by
        the function name and its parameter. It then provides a brief description of the function purporse and then the block of code 
        to be executed. When called a value will be passed into the function for example 2 and its square will be returned which
        will be 4.      
      </p>
